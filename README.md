Welcome — I build thoughtful front-end experiences, small modular systems, and mobile apps. I care about clear interfaces, accessible interactions, and tooling that ships.

## Right now — Mudo (iOS)

![Currently working on](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=Currently%20working%20on&query=$.current&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fadictonator%2Fadi.codes%2Fmaster%2F.github%2Fstatus.json&color=2b6cb0)

I’m focused on Mudo — an iOS app aiming for a polished, delightful experience. Current priorities:

- Implementing core flows and state management
- Polishing animations and transitions
- Improving offline resilience and data sync
- Shipping an early beta and iterating on feedback

If you want to test or chat about details, DM me — feedback is gold.
